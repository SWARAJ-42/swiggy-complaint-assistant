4. Press Enter or click the send button to submit your message

## Test Scenarios

You can test the following customer support scenarios by typing these phrases:

| Sample User Inputs | Follow up input (If the simulation responds with a confusion query) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "My order is late" / "Where's my food?" | "Late Delivery" |
| "Wrong items delivered" / "Some items missing" | "Wrong/Missing Items" |
| "Food was cold" / "Packaging was poor" | "Cold or Bad Food" |
| "Charged twice" / "Payment failed" | "Payment Problems" |
| "Delivery guy was rude" / "Unprofessional" | "Delivery Partner Issue" |
| "App not working" / "Can't place order" | "App/Tech Issues" |
| "I want to cancel" / "How do I cancel my order?" | "Order Cancellation" |

## What to Expect

For each scenario, the chatbot will:

1. Respond with appropriate messages
2. Generate relevant UI components to help resolve your issue
3. Guide you through the resolution process
4. Offer automated solutions where possible
5. Connect you with a human agent for complex issues

## Interactive Components

The chatbot can generate various interactive components:

- **Order Tracker**: View the real-time status of your order
- **Order Details**: See what items were in your order
- **Refund Form**: Request refunds for specific items
- **Rating Component**: Rate your experience
- **Food Quality Form**: Report issues with food quality
- **Payment Issue Form**: Report payment-related problems
- **Human Agent Connection**: Connect with a human support agent

## Tips for Testing

- Try different variations of the phrases to see how the chatbot responds
- Explore all the interactive components by clicking buttons and filling forms
- Test the chatbot's ability to handle multiple issues in a single conversation
- See how the chatbot handles automated processes vs. human escalation

## Limitations

This is a prototype with simulated responses. In a real implementation:

- The chatbot would connect to actual order data
- Refunds and cancellations would process through real payment systems
- Human agent connections would connect to real support staff
